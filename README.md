# Compiler

## Installation

* run the files "run.reg" and "run.ps1" to install the requirements
* cut the file "tostartup.ps1" and press WINDOWS KEY + R 
* Enter "shell:startup" in the window
* it will open a folder path
* paste the file "tostartup.ps1" in it

## Last Thing

By default the compiler will look to a "css" and "js" folders in 
the same directory as th e compile folder but you can change the destination
in the "gulpfile.js" line "7" for the css path and "17" for the javascript path
